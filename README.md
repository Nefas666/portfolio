[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/import?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjirihofman%2Fportfolio&env=GH_TOKEN,VC_TOKEN)

Personal portfolio website, forked from [jirihofman](https://github.com/jirihofman/portfolio). I have created a different theme from the original project while maintaining its functionalities and adding few more dependencies. You can see a preview at [https://portfolio-zulyh9wvd-nefas666s-projects.vercel.app/].

It is supposed to be used as a **template for other GitHub users' portfolios**. Data about user and projects are gathered via GitHub and Vercel API.
You can choose to comment/uncomment the __TryYourself.tsx__ in order to activate or deactivate these functionality.

## Tech stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Primer](https://primer.style/)
- **Animation**: [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/)
- **Client:**: [React](https://react.dev/)

## Running Locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nefas666/portfolio.git
cd portfolio

```


Create a `.env` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/jirihofman/profile/blob/main/.env.example).
```sh
mv .env.example .env.local
```
Add GitHub token into the new file.
```sh
GH_TOKEN=YOUR_GH_TOKEN
# If you have Vercel projects, create a token here https://vercel.com/account/tokens to get more info.
VC_TOKEN=YOUR_VERCEL_TOKEN
```
#### Environment Variables

`GH_TOKEN=YOUR_GH_TOKEN`

`VC_TOKEN=YOUR_VCTOKEN`

`IS_TEMPLATE=false`

Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh
# Install dependencies.
npm install
# Replace personal info with octocat's.
npm run setup
# Start hacking.
npm dev
```

Edit `data.json` to put your personal information there.


## Cloning / Forking

Please remove all of my personal information in `data.json` before deploying your own version of this site by running `npm run setup`. Once you are happy with your `data.json`, set
```sh
# .env or .env.local

IS_TEMPLATE=false
```
in your ENVs to prevent `npm build` from reverting `data.json` back to Octocat's data.

### To check before deploying
